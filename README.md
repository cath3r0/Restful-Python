## Hi, there!
I've created this project only for **learning** purposes,
so don't try to find here something complex or
interesting.

If you wanna try it _(at your own risk)_ then just
run with python Payster.py file and open app in browser
http://localhost:5000

Next steps to implement:
* cover code with unit and integration tests
* CI or dockerize
